- Bubble Sort     | Runtime: O(n2) average and worst case. Memory: 0(1).
- Selection Sort  | Runtime: O(n2) average and worst case. Memory: 0(1).
- Merge Sort      | Runtime: O(n log (n)) average and worst case. Memory: Depends.
- Quick Sort      | Runtime: O(n log (n)) average, 0(n2) worst case. Memory: 0(log (n)).
- Radix Sort      | Runtime: O(kn), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of passes of the sorting algorithm.
